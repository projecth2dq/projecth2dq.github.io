## Project H2DQ

Traditionally, for maintaining Quality of Service (QoS) proportional fairnes and max-min fairness policy services are used independently. In this project, we propose an optimization followed by two dimensional queue management policy, called Heirarchical Two Dimension Queue (H2DQ) integrating both proportional fairness and max-min fairness. Here proportional fairness criteria decides the traffic shaping parameters for ensuring QoS among different traffic classes, and a max-min fairness criteria decides the actual routing paths and shaping policies for different traffic flows considering the service level fairness.

H2DQ has been implemented and tested over a network setup emulated by using MiniNet enumlator platform. We are extending this work by implementing H2DQ over CloudLab to study effect of internet latency on our management policy.
